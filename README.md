# RISC-V Pipelined CPU (Verilog)

Overview: A 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor written in Verilog. It supports the RV32I instruction set and includes hazard detection, forwarding logic, and basic branching while pipelining the instructions.

##  Features

1. **5-Stage Pipeline:** Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback stages allowing multiple instructions to run simultaneously.
2. **Hazard Detection & Forwarding:** Ensures correct execution of instructions by resolving data hazards dynamically.
3. **ALU:** Handles arithmetic and logical operations such as ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.
4. **Datapath & Control Unit:** The datapath processes instructions while the control unit issues control signals to coordinate all modules.
5. **Memory System:**  
   - **Instruction Memory (IMEM):** Stores instructions.  
   - **Data Memory (DMEM):** Stores and retrieves data used during execution.
6. **Testbench:** Simulates and verifies the processor functionality under Vivado.

##  How to Simulate

1. Compile all `.v` files.
2. Include these memory files:
   - `rvpfinal.hex`(for IMEM)
   - `rvtest.hex`(for DMEM)
   - `regfile.hex`(for RegFile)
3. Run `testbench.v` as the top simulation module.
